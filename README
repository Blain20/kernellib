This is the final release of the Kernel Library, for Hydra and DGD.  The
kernellib is and has always been in the public domain (even though it was
distributed with DGD), so this repository includes the full history.

The last release only modifies this file, and moves everything else into
a src directory; it will work fine with current versions of DGD and Hydra.
There will be no further updates, and no more pull requests will be
accepted.


If you are looking for something that will track future versions of Hydra
and DGD, as of the time of writing of this file you have two options:

 * https://github.com/shentino/kernellib

   A fork that stays true to the spirit of the kernel library.

 * https://github.com/dworkin/cloud-server

   Cloud Server incorporates an extensively modified version of the
   kernel library, a snapshot of which is included on the cloud-0.7
   branch in this repository.
